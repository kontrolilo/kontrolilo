## Available hooks

### `license-check-pipenv`

**What it does**

* This hook checks the contents of a [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) environment against a definied list of allowed open source licenses.

**Configuration**

To configure the list of allowed licenses, put a file called `.license-check-pipenv.json` alongside your `Pipfile`.

The file must be structured the following way:

```json
{
  "allowed_licenses": [
    "[a list of allowed licenses]",
  ],
  "excluded_packages": [
    "[any package listed here will be excluded from the check]]",
  ]
}
```
